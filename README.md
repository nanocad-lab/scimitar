# SCIMITAR: Stochastic Computing In-Memory In-situ Tracking ARchitecture for Event-Based Cameras

This repository contains all software referred to in the SCIMITAR paper
published in the CODES+ISSS conference journal in 2024 (*LINK HERE*).

The dataset is published separately
[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gLnVfozfZAqlfP99sqSHZTvr3I-5FWUc).
This google drive folder includes both the Birds dataset under `birds/` and the
MOT20 sequence info + ground truth data under `birds-mot1.1-trimmed/`. All
included example scripts expect both these directories to be in the current
directory.

The tracking pipeline may be found in the `pipeline/` directory, and includes a
README with instructions for producing the data shown in Table II of the paper.
